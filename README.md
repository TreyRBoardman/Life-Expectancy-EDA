# Life-Expectancy-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis of world-wide life expectancy data set. 2000-2015
This data set includes a list of countries and their life expectancies from the year 2000 to 2015. In addition, the 22 columns include general health, economic, and education metrics in each country. The scope of this project is limited to data clean up and exploration.

The initial data set was accessed from a postgres SQL table, via Thinkful training services. It was then saved and formatted as a csv for ease of use. The example code to access the postgres SQL table is still available in the Jupyter notebook but is commented out.
